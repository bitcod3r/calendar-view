# calendar-view

## Introduction
This is a demo calendar frontend app, using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and some local state management implemented with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the app:

1. `npm install` – install dependencies
2. `npm test` – run all tests (should fail unless you fix the app)
3. `npm start` – serve the app at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) (it automatically opens the app in your default browser)

You can use [nvm](http://nvm.sh) to make sure you work with the same version of Node.js – run `nvm install` and nvm will set up Node.js based on `.nvmrc` file.
